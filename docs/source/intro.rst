**RIFLE** (RISC-V Feature Leagalizer) is a YAML based framework which can be used to validate the specifications of a RISC-V implementation against the RISC-V privileged and unprivileged ISA spec and generate standard specification yaml file. 

**Caution**: This is still a work in progress and non-backward compatible changes are expected to happen. 

For more information on the official RISC-V spec please visit: `RISC-V Specs <https://riscv.org/specifications/>`_
